# LSTM Next Word Predictor
A Deep Learning Model to predict next word in a sequence using LSTM.
An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) next word predictor is a type of predictive model used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. LSTM is a recurrent neural network architecture designed to address the vanishing gradient problem, allowing it to effectively capture long-term dependencies in sequential data like text.
